Subject: JavaScript Classes

Class Definitions
	Classes are named functions that can be represented using the class keyword.
	
	class Shape { }
	
	let Shape = class {}

	Shape = class Shape {}
	
	Above, are all vaild syntax for declaring a class in JavaScript.
	
Class body and Methods
	The class body is subject to a higher level of syntax stricness than other places in JavaScript
		It's under Strict mode

	The constructor method is a special method that determines how the class should be instantiated
		including any peramaters to the object itself.

	The constructor method is called when the new keyword is used to instantiate a object.
	
	Static Keyword
		The static keyword is used to move the linkage from a instantiated object, to the Class itself
			for data members and methods.
		
		Static (method name) moves the method to be a method of the class.
		
		Static (data member) moves the data member to the class.

	Super & This
		The super keyword can be used to access, and instantiate the parent object.
		
		"this" keyword is tricky to use. Using "this" when within a static method, or within a method that's
			seperated from the class will cause "this" to be undefined.
	
	Public Data Members
		Data members can either be defined at the very top of the class definition
			and then used within the constructor or defined only within the constructor.

		Below is a example.
		class Shape 
		{
		    shapeName = "";
		    shapeArea = 0;
		    shapeVolume = 0;
		function constructor(shapeName,shapeArea,shapeVolume) {

		this.shapeName = shapeName;
		this.shapeArea = shapeArea;
		this.shapeVolume = shapeVolume;

		}
		
		}
		
		or 
		class Shape 
		{

		function constructor(shapeName,shapeArea,shapeVolume) {

		this.shapeName = shapeName;
		this.shapeArea = shapeArea;
		this.shapeVolume = shapeVolume;

		}
		}
		
		Is valid.

		Private Data members
			Data members that are private cannot be accessed outside the class doing so will resole
				in a exception.

			They're made private by prefixing the member name with the pound, or hashtag "#" sign.
			
			Looking to the example above, prefixing the data members with the hashtag would result
				in the members being private.
	Extends Keyword
		The extends keyword makes this class a child of the class after the extends keyword.
		
		Example:	class Rectangel extends Shape {}
